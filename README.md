# Customer_Sales_Report

This project is about Customer_Sales_report of different malls in Turkey. I got this dataset from Kaggle. I used Micrpsoft Excel to draw insights from this report. I have used different charts and graphs to make the visualization but prior to that a lot of data cleaning was neeed to make the final report. I used the different features of Excel to clean data like CTRL+H to find and replace ambigous data. Sorting and filtering to see trends in the data. Below are some key insights from this report-
